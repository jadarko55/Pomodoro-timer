- pygame (for audio notifications)
- tkinter (usually comes with Python)

## File Structure

```
Pomodoro-timer/
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ main.py              # Main application file
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ tomato.png           # Tomato image for the UI
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ censor-beep.mp3      # Audio notification sound
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ requirements.txt     # Python dependencies
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md           # This file
```

## How to Use

1. **Start a Session**: Click the "Start" button to begin your first work session
2. **Work Focus**: Work for 25 minutes (or your custom duration)
3. **Take Breaks**: The app automatically transitions to break periods
4. **Track Progress**: Watch checkmarks appear after each completed work session
5. **Reset**: Click "Reset" to start over at any time

## The Pomodoro Technique

The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo:

1. **Work** for 25 minutes
2. **Short break** for 5 minutes
3. Repeat steps 1-2 three more times
4. **Long break** for 20 minutes
5. Repeat the entire process

## Customization

You can easily customize the timer durations by modifying these constants in `main.py`:

```python
WORK_MIN = 25          # Work session duration
SHORT_BREAK_MIN = 5    # Short break duration
LONG_BREAK_MIN = 20    # Long break duration
```

## Audio Notification

The app uses `censor-beep.mp3` for session start notifications. You can replace this file with any MP3 of your choice, just make sure to keep the same filename or update the code accordingly.

## Troubleshooting

**Sound not playing?**
- Ensure `censor-beep.mp3` is in the same folder as `main.py`
- Check that pygame is properly installed: `pip install pygame`
- Verify your system's audio is working

**Image not showing?**
- Ensure `tomato.png` is in the same folder as `main.py`
- Check file permissions
